
# Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree - REST API Project

## Description ##

In this project, I created a REST API using Express. The API provides a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, as well as adding, updating and deleting courses in the database.

In addition, the project requires users to create an account and log-in to make changes to the database.

In a future project, this will be further expanded by using React to create a client for the REST API.

To complete this project, I made use of REST API design principles, Node.js, and Express to create API routes, along with the Sequelize ORM for data modeling, validation, and persistence.

Some of the technologies used to create this project are:

- JavaScript (ES6)
- Node
- Express
- Sequelize (ORM)
- SQLite (Database)
- basic-auth for authentication
- bcryptjs for password encryption

## Access Locally

To download the project and run it on your computer you will need to execute the following commands:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/joanpujol/REST-API.git
    cd REST-API
    npm install
    npm run seed
    npm start
```

To test the Express server, browse to the URL [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/).
