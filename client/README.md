## Description

This is the client side of a Full Stack App that will provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses.

For this part of the project I've made use of:
- React
- JSX
- React Router
- React Context API
- Create React App.
- JavaScript and JSX to build out the components for your application in a modular fashion.
- React Router to set up your routes.
- Axios to fetch data from your REST API.
- Basic authentication to support users signing in.
